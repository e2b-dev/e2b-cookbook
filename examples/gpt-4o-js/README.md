# GPT-4o Code Interpreter in JS/TS
This is an example that tests the capabilities of the OpenAI's GPT-4o model. We let it generate a chart and reason about it. We use the E2B Templates SDK for running the LLM-generated code tasks in a secure and isolated cloud environment.


## Tech Stack
- [E2B Templates SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B) for running the LLM-generated code
- [OpenAI's GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/) as an LLM
- JavaScript/TypeScript

## Setup
### 1. Set up API keys
- Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
- Get the [E2B API KEY]((https://e2b.dev/docs/getting-started/api-key))
- Get the [OPENAI API KEY](https://platform.openai.com/settings)

### 2. Install packages
Install the E2B Templates SDK and OpenAI.

```
npm i
```
### 3. Run the example
```
npm run start
```

After running the program, you should get the results of two charts visualizing the height distribution and the distribution function, saved as `image_1.png` and `image_2.png` files.
