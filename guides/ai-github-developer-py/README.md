A custom AI assistant that can clone any GitHub repository to its remote cloud environment, work on the repo there, and then make pull request to GitHub.

The AI developer uses E2B sandboxes for the remote execution of tasks.

### Features
- Works directly any GitHub repository and makes a PR once done
- AI can clone the repo and edit, read, and write files
- Controllable from your terminal
- Powered by GPT-4-Turbo
- Runs in secure cloud [sandbox](https://e2b.dev/docs) by E2B
